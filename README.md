Repo for the Font.Awesome NuGet packages. **Please note that these packages and this repo are not part of the official Font Awesome project**. Use the Issues board

Packages are separated by type:

- CSS - your "standard" pre-compiled CSS version.
- Sass - same font files, but with Sass source files. You will need to compile the Sass files as your project dictates.
- Less - same font files, but with Less source files. You will need to compile the Less files as your project dictates.
